# geugenm.github.io

> just my website :)

## what this is

my digital business card that doesn't require 500mb of node_modules to display a few lines of text.

**stack:** vanilla html/css/js because apparently that's revolutionary in 2025.

**philosophy:** if it needs a build process to say "hello world", you're doing it wrong.

## what you'll find here

- contact info that actually works
- projects that don't break on ie6 (kidding, nobody cares about ie6)
- minimal design that loads faster than your webpack config

## why no frameworks

because downloading react to display static text is like using a forklift to move a coffee cup.

## local dev

```
# the sophisticated deployment process
git clone https://github.com/geugenm/geugenm.github.io.git
cd geugenm.github.io
python -m http.server 8000
# or just double-click index.html like it's 1995
```

## deployment

```
git push origin main
# github pages does the rest because it's not overthinking it
```

## contact

if you need to reach me, the website literally exists for that purpose.
